### README
A fun project where I create a bunch of balls that bounce off each other and the walls.
Collision detection and handling are way more involved that I thought, even needed to brush up some of my highschool physics.
Swing and AWT are by no means the best libraries out there to do animation.
Prior to this project I had virutal no experience with these libraries but this gave me a chance to explore them.
ChatGPT was used to help me write some of the code here.
